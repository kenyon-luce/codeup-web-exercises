    // 7. Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.
    var colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]
    console.log(colors)

    // 8. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()
    console.log("The first color is " + colors[0])

    // 9. Now do the same with the third color in the list. (Remember that array indexes start at 0, not at 1!)
    console.log("the third color is " + colors[2])

    // 10. Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).
    var lastColor = colors.indexOf(5)
    colors[lastColor] = "ultraviolet"
    console.log(colors)

    // 11. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.
    //
    // 12. Add another color to the end of the list.
    //
    // 13. Add another color to the beginning of the list.
    //
    // 14. Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()
    //
    //     15. Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.
    //
    // 16. Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.
    //
    // 17. Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.
    //
    // 18. Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list. (Hint: make use of the array's length property for this!)
